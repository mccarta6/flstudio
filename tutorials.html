		<br><dd><b>Getting Started</b></dd>
		<br><dt>To start off this tutorial, I will walk you through how to download the FL Studio program. We will be using the free version within this tutorial to accommodate for everyone. To download the program, you will need to go to the FL Studio website (<a href="url">https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-download/</a>). If you are interested, you can purchase the different paid versions as well that offer extra features. The benefit of the paid versions is that you are able to save and work on multiple projects at once, whereas the free verion does not allow you to save your progress and come back to work on them again. I suggest first trying the free version to get a feel to the program and to consider whether this is something you would enjoy doing.</dt>
		<br><dd><b>Forming an idea</b></dd>
		<br><dt>Once you have finished downloading the program, you should be ready to start your first song! Opening the program and knowing where to start can be very difficult, even for professionals. From my experience, I learned that the best way to make a song is by messing around with the program until you discover something that you like. If you play the piano or know music theory, you will have a great advantage to begin with, however if you don't, there is no need to worry. There are many different tools and methods that you can use to begin making your song.</dt>
		<br><dd><b>Using the Piano Roll</b></dd>
		<br><dt>The piano roll is where you are able to create the melodies and other aspects for your song. To use it, you will need to click on the icon at the top that looks like this:</dt>
		<br><img src="pianoRoll.png" alt="Piano roll icon" class="center">
		<br><dt>In order for your song to be created, you will need to chose a scale for your song. To do this, click on the circle with three lines. You can find this button above the piano. It should look like this:</dt>
		<br><img src="scale.png" alt="Scale icon" class="center">
		<br><dt>Once you click that you can choose any scale that you desire. If you don't like the scale that you chose, you can always go back and select a new one. Now, next to any of the piano keys, go ahead and click in one of the grey boxes. If you did this successfully, it should look like this.</dt>
		<br><img src="pianoScale.png" alt="Scale" class="center">
		<br><dt>From here, you will need to copy and paste above and below the scale you just placed. To do this, use 'ctrl + a' to select all of the notes, 'ctrl + c' to copy them, and 'ctrl + v' to paste them. It should now look like this:</dt>
		<br><img src="paste.png" alt="Scale icon" class="center">
		<br><dt>Now, go ahead and click and hold on the red notes and move them either above or below the green notes. You will want to make sure that the bottom red note has the same letter as the bottom green note. For example, in the picture the bottom green note is C6. If I were to move the red notes above the green notes, the bottom red note should say C7. To make sure that you did this right, it should look like this:</dt>
		<br><img src="placeAbove.png" alt="Scale icon" class="center">
		<br><dt>Continue to do this until the entire page is filled. Once you are done, 'ctrl + a' to select all of the notes again. You will see that there is a double sided arrow right next to the notes. Referr to the previous screenshots for an example. Click and hold the arrow, and drag it. This will make the notes longer. The reason we are doing this to to make sure that when we use our instrument, we are staying in key. From here, we will need to go and make sure that our notes are transparent for when we go to place our actual melody. To do this, go to the channel rack. The icon looks like this:</dt>
		<br><img src="channelRack.png" alt="Channel rack icon" class="center">
		<br><dt>Once this is open, you will see four boxes that say "Kick, Clap, Hat, and Snare". You will also see green circles to the left of each of them. Go ahead and click on the circle next to kick. This will mute the sound when you play the song, and we are doing this to make sure that the notes are only being used as a basis for our instument we will be adding in the next step.</dt>
		<br><dd><b>Opening an instrument/VST and Creating a Melody</b></dd>
		<br><dt>We will open an instument within the channel rack which you should still have open. For now, I will demonstrate this using the basic piano included within FL Studios, however you can do this with any VST. To do this, click the '+' button at the bottom and choose the 'FL Keys' option under the Misc section. Once this is open, you can go ahead and close it and return to the piano roll. Now that you have your piano roll open using the FL Pianos VST, the page should look like this:</dt>
		<br><img src="ghostKeys.png" alt="Ghost keys" class="center">
		<br><dt>Wherever there is a line with a white outline, you should stick to placing your keys here. Now it's time for the fun part. Go ahead and place your notes however you'd like to. You can either create chords like this:</dt>
		<br><img src="chords.png" alt="Chords" class="center">
		<br><dt>Or, you can create a melody, which would look like this:</dt>
		<br><img src="melody.png" alt="Melody" width="700" class="center">
		<br><dt>If you want to make a complete sounding song, I would suggest doing both, one of them using a different instrument. To do this, you will want to create the seprate pattern using the pattern selector. This is where you will do that:</dt>
		<br><img src="patternSelector.png" alt="Pattern Selector" class="center">
 		<br><dt>Once you have created all of the patterns you like, navigate to the 'View Playlist' button. This is at the top of the screen as well and it looks like this:</dt>
		<br><img src="viewPlaylist.png" alt="View Playlist" class="center">
		<br><dt> Once you are here, you will see on the side multiple different patterns. You can drag and place these patterns however you'd like. It should look something like this:
		<br><img src="patterns.png" alt="Patterns placed together" width="700" class="center">
		<br><dt>To listen to the pattern you created, all you have to do is press the space button. You can continue to create different melodies and chords as many times as you want and with as many different instruments as well. Have as much fun as you'd like!</dt>
		<br><dd><b>Creating a drum pattern.</b></dd>
		<br><dt>Depending on what kind of song you are making, you may want to create a drum beat. To do this, we will use the four VST's that have already been loaded to the channel rack. You can go into the kick piano roll by right clicking on it and selecting piano roll. You can also go ahead and delete all of the notes placed there by right clicking on them. Now you can go back to the channel rack. Once there, you will see a set of blocks to the right of each instrument. You can click on these boxes to create your drum pattern. Once you are done it should look like this:</dt>
		<br><img src="drums.png" alt="Drum Pattern" width="700" class="center">
		<br><dt>When you are finished creating your pattern, go ahead and place them on the playlist wherever you would like.</dt>
		<br><dd><b>Congrats!</b></dd>
		<br><dt>You have now created your first song. There are many different techniques that you will learn down the line by messing with the program, however this is a great base to start off with. Hopefully this tutorial helped and that you are able to create a number of amazing songs!</dt>
