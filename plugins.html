		<br><dd><b>Fruity Parametric EQ 2</b></dd>
		<br><dt>This plugin that is essential to mastering a sound. By using this plugin, you are able to get rid of any unwanted "high" or "low" sounds that you may hear in your instrument. This will help to make your song sound more sharp and it will differentiate all of the instruments so that you can hear each one during the song.</dt>
		<br><dd><b>Fuity Reverb</b></dd>
		<br><dt>Fruity Reverb is great when you want your instruments to sound more distant. You can even choose presets such as "cathedrial" and "drum studio" which will make your instrument sound just as if they were being played in those spaces.</dt>
		<br><dd><b>Fruity Delay 3</b><dd>
		<br><dt>In my opinion, this plugin is the best of the three delay plugins included with FL Studios. With it, you can make your instruments echo and resonate.</dt>
